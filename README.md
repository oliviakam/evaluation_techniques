Evaluation Techniques as taught for Program Evaluation

This is an R Markdown that was used to demonstrate 
program evaluation techniques to a class of 38 graduates students. 

Most (60%) of students rated their level of R experience as 1 or 2
on a scale of 1-5 on R familiarity at the beginning of class.

I led a 4-week workshop to teach R. Then I uploaded weekly 
instructional videos 5 addional weeks for each of the 
methods learned. 

Topics covered were: 
1. Hypthothesis testing
2. Bivariate regression
3. Multivariate regression
4. Logistic regression
5. Random sampling
6. Propensity score matching
7. Visual packages including stargazer and ggplot2
